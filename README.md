below is the original info about the project:

Edit PATH environment on Windows conveniently

The default environment editor is not great at editing PATH if there are lot of entries and many of them are similar looking.

1. Implemented using Win32, **Does not depend on MFC or .NET**
2. Missing folders are highlighted with different icon.
3. To edit System PATH, offers to be launched with elevated admin privilege, similar to "Run as Administrator"
4. Double clicking any path entry attempts to open in Windows Explorer.
